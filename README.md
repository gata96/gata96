### 🍒Me🍒
---
Hello. I'm Oh Eunjeong,  
who dreams of becoming a talented developer

<br>

### 💻Why did I participate in KDT training?
---
I joined the IT Front End as a new developer on December 1, 2021.  
However, since I had no IT major or development experience, I was not able to follow the company's work with Novase.  
It wasn't that I didn't have a new job, but I had to go into the field right away  
There was no learning stage of Step by Step, and I felt a great disparity between education and knowledge in the actual field.  
With this experience, I can kick a soccer ball on a lawn that is better than the bare ground  
I thought it was important to lay the foundation as a developer in order to be put into the company's work.⚽

<br>

### 📈Career goals
---
My goal is to work in the IT field in Europe or the United States. It is good to have a career in Korea, but I want to fulfill my dream by blending with various people and culture in a wider world.


<br>

### 🎯My life goal
---

Growing life 💡 I want to be a better person today than yesterday, tomorrow than today, whether it be my career or my inner self.
